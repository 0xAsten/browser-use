Simple demonstration of the CDP feature.

To test this locally, follow these steps:
1. Create a shortcut for the executable Chrome file.
2. Add the following argument to the shortcut:
   - On Windows: `--remote-debugging-port=9222`
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9222/json/version` to verify that the Remote Debugging Protocol (CDP) is running.
4. Launch this example.

@dev You need to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable before proceeding.

In localhost:3000 playing a grid-based inventory management game. Your goal is to optimize character stats (Attack, Defense, Health) by strategically placing and managing items on a grid while managing your gold resources.
Key Game Mechanics to Consider:
1. Grid Placement
	- Items can be placed on a grid with specific dimensions
	- Items can be rotated (0째, 90째, 180째, 270째) with shift button clicked while dragging
	- Items must be placed validly (within bounds, not overlapping)
	- Items can be discarded by dragging them off the grid
	- All non-bag items must be placed on top of bags
	- Bags serve as the foundation for other items
	- Exception: Bags themselves can be placed directly on the grid
	- Items cannot overlap with other items
2. Shop System
	- Shop offers 4 items at a time
	- Can reroll shop items for a gold cost (REROLL_COST)
	- Each item has:
		a. Price (gold cost)
		b. Stats (attack, defense, health)
		c. Dimensions (width, height)
	- Each reroll will randomize the items
	- Consider rerolling if the items are not optimal
3. Resource Management
	- Manage gold currency
	- Balance between buying items vs saving for rerolls
	- Consider special effects from item combinations
4. Dragging Items
	- From Shop to Grid
		a. Click and hold on a shop item
		b. Drag it over the grid
		c. A preview will appear showing where the item will be placed
		d. Release to place the item if position is valid
	- Discarding Items
		a. Click and hold on a placed item
		b. Drag it outside the grid boundaries
		c. Release to discard
		d. Note: Cannot discard bags that have items on top
Note: 
- Always to reroll to have a bag to start with
- Click and hold left mouse button to drag items
- When it is successfully dragged to the inventory, it means the purchase is successful
- Shift + click and hold left mouse button to rotate items
		
Objectives:
1. Primary: Maximize total stats (ATK + DEF + HP)
2. Secondary: Efficient gold usage
3. Tertiary: Optimal grid space utilization

For each turn, you should:
1. Evaluate current inventory layout
2. Analyze available shop items for:
	a. Stats per gold cost efficiency
	b. Space efficiency (dimensions vs stats)
	c. Potential synergies with existing items
3. Decide between:
	a. Buying and placing an available item
	b. Rerolling the shop
	c. Reorganizing existing items (including discarding)
