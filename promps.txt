You are given a website image and corresponding cleaned up HTML.
Your task is to very accurately describe what you see on the website and give me back the functionality and the options of the functionality.

For example, if you see a search bar and there are filter, I want you to give me back "search function" and parameters "param1, "param2", ...
Also, with each param give me the button/element id/c="" that user should press to activate the functionality (for inputs, dropdowns, etc).
(I engineered cost saving method c=""). Reference each button with css selector by c=

Extract as much functionality as possible to a single function, and group functions together, so that it still makes sense. Make 100% certain that each param has functionality connected to it (instruction on what to press).
